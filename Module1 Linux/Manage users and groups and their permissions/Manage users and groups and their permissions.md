her there is only one user and its name is `htb-ac480198`

*   we can see the users and their assigned groups in `/etc/passwd`
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%201.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%201.png)

    we can see `htb-ac480198:x:1000:1003:,,,:/home/htb-ac480198:/bin/bash` where
    
    *   `htb-ac480198` is the user name ,
    
    *   `x` is the password and its represented as x for security
    
    *   `1000` is the user id, assigned automatically when creating the user. and each user has a unique id
    
    *   `1003` is the group id that this user is in, and is stored in /etc/group
    
    *   `/home/htb-ac480198:` is the user home directory
    
    *   `/bin/bash` path of user shell

*   `adduser username` to add a user
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%203.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%203.png)
    
    *   note that the user id and the group id get assigned automatically
    
    *   we can see that the user has been added in `/etc/passwd` with `UID=1001` and `GID=1004` and assigned a new directory `/home/tom` in the home directory
        
        [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%204.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%204.png)

Note: whenever we create a new user, a new group is created automatically (primary group) to that user with the same name as the user name and with a unique GID

*   `sudo passwd username` change the password of a user
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%206.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%206.png)
    

*   `su - username` switch to another user
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%207.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%207.png)
    

*   `sudo groupadd groupName` add a group
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%208.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%208.png)

    we can see `devops:x:1005` is added
    

*   `sudo usermod -g anotherPrimaryGroup username` change the primary group of a user to another group
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2010.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2010.png)

    *   we can see the GID is changed from 1004 to 1005 which is the GID of devops group
    
    *   now we donâ€™t need the tom group, we can delete it `sudo delgroup tom`
        
        [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2012.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2012.png)

Note: we can add a user to multiple groups (a secondary group in addition to the primary group) and that user will have the permissions of all the groups that he is in.

*   `sudo usermod -G secondrGgroup username` add the user to a secondary group in addition to the primary group, `secondrGgroup` can be one or a list (g1,g2,g3,â€¦)
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2013.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2013.png)
    

*   note that if we add another `secondrGgroup` with the above command the `secondrGgroup`will be overwritten
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2014.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2014.png)
    

*   `sudo usermod -aG secondrGgroup username` to append to the existing `secondrGgroup`s.
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2015.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2015.png)
    

*   `groups username` displays the groups assigned to a user

*   we can add a user to a specific primary group a the creation of a new user instead of adding the primary group after the creation and then deleting the automatically created group
    
    *   `sudo useradd -g devops niklaus`
    
    [![](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2016.png)](Manage%20users%20and%20groups%20and%20their%20permissions%2067aaabe0eeb048ce9f3d20bb96ddb7e9/Untitled%2016.png)
